## TMAY – Abinaya Version

Hi, I’m Abinaya Sankaralingam, but you can call me Abi. I’m a cloud data engineer with over 10 years of experience building reliable, scalable data platforms.

Currently, I’m at Scotiabank, where I work on modernizing customer data pipelines. I led the migration from legacy ETL systems to cloud-native microservices using Talend, Kafka, and Spring Boot on GCP. This improved throughput by over 80%, reduced operational risk, and helped us stay compliant with Quebec’s Bill 64. I also designed a secure PII purge pipeline that consistently meets a 99% SLA, which was critical for data governance.

Earlier, I spent several years at Accenture, working with clients like Comcast, Nokia, and Pfizer. At Comcast, I started as the sole engineer on a sales enablement solution — built the backend infrastructure from scratch — which grew into an enterprise-wide platform across 16 regions. I later led and scaled the team as it expanded. I also led a global team of 25 to build a compensation pipeline that reduced payout delays from 7 days to 2 for over 25,000 reps.

I’m hands-on with Python, SQL, and data engineering tools like Talend, Spring Boot, and Snowflake, and I’ve worked across GCP, Azure, and now I’m diving into AWS. I’m also experimenting with Gen AI tools like LangChain, currently building a personal planner on the side.

I love solving real problems with clean, reliable solutions — and I’m excited about opportunities where I can keep learning and make a positive impact. That’s what brings me here to AWS.

## Why AWS?

1. **Innovation + Scale**  
AWS is the most adopted cloud platform globally, and I admire how it consistently leads with innovation—whether it’s serverless tech, data lakes, or generative AI. For someone in data and analytics, it's a playground of possibilities.

2. **Customer Obsession Culture**  
What draws me most to AWS is the culture of customer obsession. As a Delivery Consultant, I want to work directly with customers and help them unlock value through the cloud—and AWS puts customers at the center of every decision.

3. **Learning + Impact**  
AWS pushes its employees to think big, raise the bar, and never stop learning. I’m excited about the opportunity to work with cutting-edge tools while making a real impact on businesses across industries.

I’m a senior data engineer with over 10 years of experience designing and delivering end-to-end data solutions, primarily in banking and enterprise settings. I currently work on cloud-native pipelines using Talend and GCP, and I’m actively transitioning toward AWS-based architectures and consulting roles.

I’ve led multiple ETL modernization projects, designed MDM microservices, and mentored junior engineers along the way. I bring a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data governance, and system integration.

Recently, I’ve been expanding into AWS through the SAA certification and hands-on projects involving Glue, S3, Redshift, and serverless services. I’m especially excited about roles like this one because I enjoy working with clients directly, solving real-world data problems, and delivering scalable cloud solutions using modern data and AI tools.

My goal is to grow as a trusted advisor in the data and analytics space, helping customers succeed in their cloud journey with AWS.
