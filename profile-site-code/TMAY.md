## TMAY – Abinaya Version

I’m a senior data engineer with over 10 years of experience designing and delivering end-to-end data solutions, primarily in banking and enterprise settings. I currently work on cloud-native pipelines using Talend and GCP, and I’m actively transitioning toward AWS-based architectures and consulting roles.

I’ve led multiple ETL modernization projects, designed MDM microservices, and mentored junior engineers along the way. I bring a strong foundation in SQL, Python, data governance, and system integration.

Recently, I’ve been expanding into AWS through the SAA certification and hands-on projects involving Glue, S3, Redshift, and serverless services. I’m especially excited about roles like this one because I enjoy working with clients directly, solving real-world data problems, and delivering scalable cloud solutions using modern data and AI tools.

My goal is to grow as a trusted advisor in the data and analytics space, helping customers succeed in their cloud journey with AWS.


## Why AWS?

1. **Innovation + Scale**  
AWS is the most adopted cloud platform globally, and I admire how it consistently leads with innovation—whether it’s serverless tech, data lakes, or generative AI. For someone in data and analytics, it's a playground of possibilities.

2. **Customer Obsession Culture**  
What draws me most to AWS is the culture of customer obsession. As a Delivery Consultant, I want to work directly with customers and help them unlock value through the cloud—and AWS puts customers at the center of every decision.

3. **Learning + Impact**  
AWS pushes its employees to think big, raise the bar, and never stop learning. I’m excited about the opportunity to work with cutting-edge tools while making a real impact on businesses across industries.
