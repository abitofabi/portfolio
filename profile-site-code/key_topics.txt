Spark Basics to Cover:
What is Apache Spark? (In-memory distributed processing engine)

Core components: Driver, Executors, RDDs, DataFrames, Spark SQL

Spark architecture: Master, workers, cluster manager (standalone, YARN, Mesos)

Basic transformations vs actions (map, filter, reduceByKey, collect)

How Spark handles parallelism and fault tolerance

Common Spark use cases in ETL and analytics pipelines

Basics of partitioning, shuffling, and how to optimize (to talk about handling data skew, etc.)

Quick Learning Resources:
Databricks free training: Getting Started with Apache Spark

Official Apache Spark docs: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/

YouTube intro videos: Search “Apache Spark explained” for quick overviews

Hands-on: Try a simple PySpark notebook (Google Colab has free runtimes) to practice transformations and actions

Leverage Spark SQL: If you know SQL, learn how Spark SQL extends it for big data queries
