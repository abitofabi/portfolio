## ‚úÖ Bill 64 ‚Äì PII Purge Compliance Pipeline

**Situation:**  
I led the customer data integration system for a major Canadian bank, responsible for building scalable pipelines for real-time and batch processing. As part of a legal compliance initiative under Quebec‚Äôs Law 25 (Bill 64), we had to implement an automated purge system for sensitive PII data.

**Task:**  
Design and deliver a system that ensures timely deletion of customer records while maintaining auditability, traceability, and compliance SLAs.

**Action:**  
- Personally designed the purge pipeline, integrating with metadata and lineage layers.
- Collaborated with legal, security, and audit teams to align on logic, edge cases, and exception handling.
- Enabled lineage tagging of exceptions and tracked the audit trail end-to-end using metadata enrichment.
- Delivered full observability and retry logic to ensure resilience.

**Result:**  
- Achieved **99.6% SLA** for PII data deletion within legal windows.  
- Remaining 0.4% flagged and legally retained as per policy.
